# GMail incoming mail addresses
Very simple script using Google's GMail API to find out which email addresses have been used to receive mail in your GMail account.

I was getting too much spam, so I needed to turn off my catch all, which meant finding out all the addresses I used. This script does that and dumps it to the screen.

It's only a bare minimum of an update from the Google example, but I thought it was useful to have online, and maybe someone could write more API to add the aliases automatically and turn off catch all.
